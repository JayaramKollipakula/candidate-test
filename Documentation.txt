Following is the basic application structure of the project.

- app
        ----- models/
        ---------- nerd.js <!-- the nerd model to handle CRUD -->
    ----- routes.js
    - config
        ----- db.js 
    - node_modules <!-- created by npm install -->
    - public <!-- all frontend and angular stuff -->
    ----- css
    ----- js
    ---------- controllers <!-- angular controllers -->
    ---------- services <!-- angular services -->
    ---------- app.js <!-- angular application -->
    ---------- appRoutes.js <!-- angular routes -->
    ----- img
    ----- libs <!-- created by bower install -->
    ----- views 
    ---------- home.html
    ---------- nerd.html
    ---------- geek.html
    ----- index.html
    - .bowerrc <!-- tells bower where to put files (public/libs) -->
    - bower.json <!-- tells bower which files we need -->
    - package.json <!-- tells npm which packages we need -->
    - server.js <!-- set up our node application -->

1.	First I created package.json file, then our application will know that we want to use Express and Mongoose.
2.	I installed all modules which are required to the application like mongoose, express etc…
3.	Created a DB config file where connection will establish to MongoDB.
4.	Then index.html, this file we have to place in ‘public’ folder.
5.	Then angularJS for front-end work will require a few things:
•	Files and libraries brought in by Bower
•	Angular application structure (controllers, services).
In this app we can create a profile for desired rug (add a rug), view details of rug and also can delete rug.
App is working on local host but there are some issues when running in nodeJS.
